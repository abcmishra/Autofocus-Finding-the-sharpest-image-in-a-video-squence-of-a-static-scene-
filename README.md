Autofocus is implemented in all digital cameras these days. 
While using your phone camera, you may have noticed, the camera goes out of focus for a second or two, and the image looks blurry for a bit. The camera quickly performs some calculations and autofocuses to bring the subject in focus. 
In SLR cameras, autofocus is activated when we press the button half way through. You can see and hear parts of the lens moving as the camera tries to autofocus. 
Whether it is an SLR camera or your phone camera, autofocussing is done by taking a series of photos of the scene while changing the distance of the image sensor from the lens inside the camera.
